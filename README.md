## Project Description: 
- The goal of this project was to create a book library using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Clicking on an "Add Book" button, will allow the user to type information about a book, and then add it to their collection. For this project, each book is an object and is temporarily stored inside of an array. The library is displayed by looping through the entire array, and displaying each book object on it's own separate card. 

## What I've learned:
- How to create object constructors.
- Understanding the "this" keyword, when to use it and what it refers to depending on where it's used.
- Using push to append new object to an array.
- How to create an overlay that appears and disappears.
- Using data attributes to link DOM elements to an array index.
- Changing property values inside of an array
- Understanding object prototypes and when to use them.
- Using auto-fill and minmax to create a responsive design. 
- Using word-break to ensure text doesn't overflow container.


## Final Thoughts:
This project was really good practice using Javascript to store user input inside of a data structure (in this case an array). I also found this project really useful in understanding why you might want to create object constructors, especially in the case of creating n amount of books for the library. Learning how to chain prototypes was also really cool. Overall, I'm really satisfied with the result!
